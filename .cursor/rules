# Mira - AI Company Research Tool (Monorepo)

Agentic AI library for company research that automatically analyzes companies by scraping their websites, social media, and public information. Uses 5 specialized AI agents to extract comprehensive business intelligence.

**Key Features:**

- Agentic AI library for deep company analysis
- Real-time web scraping with intelligent content extraction

- Server-sent events for live progress tracking

**MONOREPO STRUCTURE**:

- `packages/mira-ai/` - Core TypeScript library (reusable npm package)
- `packages/mira-frontend/` - Next.js 15 frontend application

## Code Style & Naming

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case for files: `company-analysis.ts`, `data-merger.ts`
- Use PascalCase for components: `CompanyProgress.tsx`
- Use descriptive names that explain purpose: `linkedin-company-scraper.ts`

### Variable & Function Naming

- Use camelCase: `researchCompany`, `progressCallback`
- Be descriptive: `scrapingBeeClient` not `client`
- Prefer verb-noun for functions: `createProgressReporter`, `mergeDataPoints`
- Use meaningful constants: `PROGRESS_EVENTS`, `DATA_POINT_TYPES`

### Code Quality

- Use TypeScript strictly with proper type definitions
- Prefer const over let, avoid var completely
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibility
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names that describe business purpose

## Monorepo Guidelines

- Import between packages using package names: `import { researchCompany } from 'mira-ai'`
- Never use relative paths between packages: `../../../mira/src/types`
- Keep shared types in appropriate package domains
- Use npm workspaces for dependency management
- Each package has specific .cursor/rules for detailed guidelines

## Git Conventions

- Conventional commits: `feat(core): add linkedin scraping`, `fix(frontend): progress bar styling`
- One logical change per commit with clear scope
- Use descriptive messages that explain business impact
- Reference issues/PRs when applicable
