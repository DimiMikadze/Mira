# Mira Frontend Rules

## Next.js

- Use App Router, not Pages Router
- Server components by default, client only when needed
- Import from 'mira-ai' for server code, 'mira-ai/types' for client
- Use proper error boundaries

## React

- Functional components only
- Use hooks properly (deps arrays, cleanup)
- Keep components focused on single responsibility

## API Routes

- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use Server-Sent Events for progress updates

## UI

- Use shadcn/ui components
- Follow existing design patterns
- Keep accessibility in mind
