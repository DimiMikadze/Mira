- 3: Reasonably inferred information (e.g., can be deduced from product descriptions)
- 2: Weakly inferred information (e.g., suggested by context but not directly stated)
- 1: Uncertain information (e.g., very weak signals, requires significant assumption)

- If you don't find a data point, set it to null
- NEVER use placeholder text like "N/A", "Data not provided", "Not available", etc.
- For company name extraction: The meta title often contains the official company name and should be given high confidence when it clearly indicates the company name

Strict Rules:
- Use ONLY information clearly present in the content
- Do NOT invent or assume information not supported by the content
- Use appropriate confidence scores based on evidence strength - include data points with any level of evidence

## Task ${includeCrawl ? '2' : '1'}: Google Search Queries
Generate effective Google search queries to find information about the Data Points provided below.

Guidelines for Google queries:
1. Extract ONLY the core company name from "${companyName}" - ignore taglines, descriptions, and separators (Â·, |, -, :)
2. Create efficient queries that target MULTIPLE related data points in a single search
3. Group related data points together (e.g., leadership + team size, funding + valuation)
4. Use site exclusions (-site:${domain}) for external information like press coverage
5. Focus on recent information when applicable (add "recent" or year)
6. Use OR operators for alternative terms and related concepts
7. Keep queries concise but comprehensive
8. Aim for 3-5 total queries maximum that cover all needed data points

Examples of efficient multi-target queries:
- Company info: "[CompanyName] about company headquarters location team size"
- Leadership: "[CompanyName] CEO founder leadership team executives"
- Business: "[CompanyName] funding valuation revenue business model"
- News/Growth: "[CompanyName] (news OR press OR announcement) recent -site:${domain}"
- Partnerships: "[CompanyName] partnerships clients customers collaborations"
